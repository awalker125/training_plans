notes:
  - 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I havent done this for a while now.
  - Do this on Monday or early in the week. On a wednesday do 50% + bands close grip. 6-8 doubles.
  - Pause everything on the chest.
  - "**PAUSE EVERYTHING AT LOCKOUT**"
  - Try to generate as much speed off the chest as possible but especially with the bands
  - On a friday go up to a heavy double. Aim for 90% week 1 but leave some in the tank. No grinders or misses. Try to build momentum each week by putting 1kg on your 90%. Dont go too heavy too early. Especially because this is based on a 77.5. 65x2 week 1 would be ideal.
