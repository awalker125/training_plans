### Notes

- 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style
- Do this on Monday or early in the week. On a wednesday do 50% + bands close grip. 6-8 doubles.
- Pause everything on the chest.
- **PAUSE EVERYTHING AT LOCKOUT**
- Try to generate as much speed of the chest as possible but especially with the bands
- On a friday go up to a heavy double. Aim for 90% week 1 but leave some in the tank. No grinders or misses. Try to build momentum each week by putting 1kg on you 90%. Dont go too heavy too early.
