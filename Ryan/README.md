#### Plan

 ... | Sets/Reps | Weight | Olympic | Power
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 5x4@72% | 172.8 | 173.0 | 172.5
2 | 8x2@77% | 184.8 | 185.0 | 185.0
3 | 6x2@82% | 196.8 | 197.0 | 197.5
4 | 3x3@87% | 208.8 | 209.0 | 210.0
5 | 6x1@92% | 220.8 | 221.0 | 220.0

### Notes

- Have reduced the overall volume for next 5 weeks.
- 92% week should be the week before comp. Then starter early on in comp week. Probably 2x1 at 90% for speed would be good.
- Keep doing your core and grip assistance. Try to push hard the first 3 weeks so you are sore then reduce it down but dont stop.
- If you've hammered squats then do these later in the week or drop the weight as you need to.
