### Notes

- 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go.
- If this feels too light then instead of increasing weight try to focus on speed and tightness in core
- This 6 weeks is really only to see where you are and get a bit of volume in
- Assistance is:
-  - pull ups
-  - toes to bar or knees to elbows (without straps)
-  - plate flips
-  - loaded barbell hold 30 sec
