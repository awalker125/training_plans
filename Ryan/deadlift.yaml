notes:
  - 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go.
  - If this feels too light then instead of increasing weight try to focus on speed and tightness in core
  - This 6 weeks is really only to see where you are and get a bit of volume in
  - "Assistance is:"
  - " - pull ups"
  - " - toes to bar or knees to elbows (without straps)"
  - " - plate flips"    
  - " - loaded barbell hold 30 sec"
