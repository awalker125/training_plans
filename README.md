training_plans
===================================


Some training plans for Parkhead and Wansbeck athletes.

## TODO

* Implement inols which vary session by session e.g 1.2, 1, 0.8, 1.2, 0.6
* Implement options e.g where the target inol is 0.8 there maybe 4 or 5 options to get close to that. A way to show them all
* Implement target inol - AMRAP **
* Implement target inol - Heavy Single ***
* Implement creep up e.g set 1 is 80kg set 2 is 81kg set 3 is 82kg

** would need to "pad" the sets or reps so that overall the programmed sets/reps are easier leaving something in the tank for the AMRAP. Need a way to calculate the total inol after the AMRAP for tracking purposes.
*** probably just assume the heavy single is 90 - 95% and take that off the target inol. E.g 1x1 @90 is about 0.1, 1x1 @ 95 is about 0.2
