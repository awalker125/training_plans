notes:
  - 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go.
  - If this feels too light then instead of increasing weight try to focus on speed and tightness in core
  - Week 1 should feel like nothing and is a bit of a deload albeit with alot of reps.
  - This 6 weeks is really only to see where you are and get a bit of volume in
  - "Assistance is:"
  - " pull ups. If you can do 3 sets of 10 then add weight. If not try to add reps each week over you sets. You want around 30 reps. So 6x5 or 3x10 is good."
  - " anti-extension ab work. E.g ab wheel, hollow rock, deadbug or all 3"
