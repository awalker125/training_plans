### Notes

- 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go. Alternatively you can do a 2 rep max.
- Try to pause all reps comp style. Especially in the early weeks when its light.
- Assistance is:
-  push ups. 3 sets of high reps. If you can do 30 then do 30/20/10. If you can do 21 to 21/15/9. If you can only do 15 then do 15/12/9. If you can do more than 30 unbroken just drop 10 a set. I've only ever been up to 45/35/25 so I cant tell you if the drops need to be bigger for 50+ reps.
-  anti-extension ab work. E.g ab wheel, hollow rock, deadbug or all 3
