notes:
  - 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go. Alternatively you can do a 2 rep max.
  - If this feels too light then instead of increasing weight try to focus on speed and technique.
  - Try to maintain a full grip on the bar and high elbows. If you struggle drop weight and/or use straps. This will help your clean in the long run.
