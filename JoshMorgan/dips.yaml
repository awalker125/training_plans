notes:
  - 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go. Alternatively you can do a 2 rep max.
  - Watch the range of motion at first. I like to go just below 90% but some people get shoulder problems so go to where you need to.
  - Take your bodyweight of the weight. So if you weigh 76 and it says do 96 you'd put 20kg plate on the belt.
