## Bench

### Summary

Weeks | Max | Target INOL | Max Reps | Max Sets
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
6 | 110 | 0.8 | 10 | 6

#### Plan

 ... | Sets/Reps | Weight | Olympic | Power
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 4x7@65% | 71.5 | 72.0 | 72.5
2 | 6x4@70% | 77.0 | 77.0 | 77.5
3 | 5x4@75% | 82.5 | 83.0 | 82.5
4 | 4x4@80% | 88.0 | 88.0 | 87.5
5 | 6x2@85% | 93.5 | 94.0 | 92.5
6 | 4x2@90% | 99.0 | 99.0 | 100.0
7 | 4x1@95% | 104.5 | 105.0 | 105.0

### Notes

- 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go. Alternatively you can do a 2 rep max.
- Try to pause all reps comp style. Especially in the early weeks when its light.
- Assistance is:
-  push ups. 3 sets of high reps. If you can do 30 then do 30/20/10. If you can do 21 to 21/15/9. If you can only do 15 then do 15/12/9. If you can do more than 30 unbroken just drop 10 a set. I've only ever been up to 45/35/25 so I cant tell you if the drops need to be bigger for 50+ reps.
-  anti-extension ab work. E.g ab wheel, hollow rock, deadbug or all 3

## Deadlift

### Summary

Weeks | Max | Target INOL | Max Reps | Max Sets
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
6 | 190 | 0.9 | 6 | 8

#### Plan

 ... | Sets/Reps | Weight | Olympic | Power
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 8x4@65% | 123.5 | 124.0 | 122.5
2 | 7x4@70% | 133.0 | 133.0 | 132.5
3 | 8x3@75% | 142.5 | 143.0 | 142.5
4 | 6x3@80% | 152.0 | 152.0 | 152.5
5 | 7x2@85% | 161.5 | 162.0 | 162.5
6 | 3x3@90% | 171.0 | 171.0 | 170.0
7 | 4x1@95% | 180.5 | 181.0 | 180.0

### Notes

- 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go.
- If this feels too light then instead of increasing weight try to focus on speed and tightness in core
- Week 1 should feel like nothing and is a bit of a deload albeit with alot of reps.
- This 6 weeks is really only to see where you are and get a bit of volume in
- Assistance is:
-  pull ups. If you can do 3 sets of 10 then add weight. If not try to add reps each week over you sets. You want around 30 reps. So 6x5 or 3x10 is good.
-  anti-extension ab work. E.g ab wheel, hollow rock, deadbug or all 3

## Dips

6 | 6x1@90% | 94.5 | 95.0 | 95.0
7 | 3x1@95% | 99.75 | 100.0 | 100.0

### Notes

- 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go. Alternatively you can do a 2 rep max.
- Watch the range of motion at first. I like to go just below 90% but some people get shoulder problems so go to where you need to.
- Take your bodyweight of the weight. So if you weigh 76 and it says do 96 you'd put 20kg plate on the belt.
