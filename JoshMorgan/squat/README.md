### Notes

- 95% week is test week. You dont have to do this but if you do want to see where you are do a heavy single. e.g 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% comp style. I wouldnt do this unless you are feeling great and fancy a go. Alternatively you can do a 2 rep max.
- If this feels too light then instead of increasing weight try to focus on speed and technique.
- Week 1 should feel like nothing and is a bit of a deload albeit with alot of reps.
- This 6 weeks is really only to see where you are and get a bit of volume in
