### Notes

- pause everything (mississippi style)
- dont panic
- Heavy double +1kg each week starting at 99kg
- Do this early in the week
- Bands mid week
- Heavy doubles close grip end of week. No failures or grinders. I think the kids call that RPE9.5
- Bands do 4-8 doubles. Concentrate on speed off chest.
- Start at 55kg + band of your choice.
- If in doubt use lighter band.
