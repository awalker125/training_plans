notes:
  - pause everything (mississippi style)
  - dont panic
  - Heavy double +1kg each week starting at 99kg
  - Do this early in the week
  - Bands mid week
  - Heavy doubles close grip end of week. No failures or grinders. I think the kids call that RPE9.5
  - Bands do 4-8 doubles. Concentrate on speed off chest. 
  - Start at 55kg + band of your choice. 
  - If in doubt use lighter band.
